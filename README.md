This app enables employees to generate new secured passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript.

My motivation for this work is to improve my DOM manipulation skills and practice using the following in JS: building functions, charAt(), Math.random(), eventListener, document queries, variables etc.

- WHEN asked for character types to include in the password I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
- WHEN I answer each prompt, my input is validated and at least one character type is selected
